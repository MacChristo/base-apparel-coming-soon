### What I learned

I've done quite a few JavaScript project now for beginners. It's still pretty hard for me though but I getting on quite well. I will continue to take on more project to polish  my JS skills. In this project, I learned a lot about `form` validations. This project was really interesting indeed.

### Continued development

I'm still a beginner in javascript. So I will continue to forge ahead and complete more projects until I become confident in my Javascript abilities.
